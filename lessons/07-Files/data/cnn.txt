Eric Spinato, the head booker and senior story editor for the Fox Business Network, died over the weekend, the network said Monday.

Spinato's brother, Dean, wrote on social media that the cause of death had been the coronavirus.
"COVID took my brother today," he wrote. "He was a gem and one of a kind. I'm so broken and lost for words."
Spinato worked at Fox for nearly 20 years. He joined the network in 1998, before briefly leaving in 2004 to work at CNN and MSNBC. He returned to Fox in 2007 and worked at the company ever since, working primarily with Maria Bartiromo.
Fox Business host David Asman reported on Spinato's death Monday afternoon.
In a memo sent to employees Monday, Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott, Fox News president Jay Wallace, and Fox Business president Lauren Petterson said Spinato's contributions to the company "were immeasurable."
"Eric was an immensely gifted and aggressive booker and was renowned for booking the innumerable 'gets' we've seen on both FNC and FBN over the years," they wrote. "He was also always willing to lend a hand to help a colleague, mentor union staffers or troubleshoot an issue â€” countless bookers throughout the industry learned the ropes and the tools of the trade from Eric at one point or another in their careers."
