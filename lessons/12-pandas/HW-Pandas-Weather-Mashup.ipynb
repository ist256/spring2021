    "### Load the 7 day forecast from into Pandas!\n",
    "\n",
    "This example will help you understand how to learn new services and mash them up into a working solution. It is a great example of the same process of problem analysis and troubleshooting you will need to complete your project, only on a much smaller scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal is to input a location like `Miami, Fl` and then output the 7 day forecast in a Pandas Dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a weather API. You can use the https://openweathermap.org/ API from a previous class example, or https://www.weatherapi.com/ Your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might need a geocoder. Rather than using the open street map API, why not try to use a Geocoding Python module instead? This will give you an example of how Python modules serve as wrappers to API's. I suggest trying  Python geocoder module for this: https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/ , specifically the Open Street Maps service. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your weather API will return the 7 Day forecast as a JSON, which can easily be de-serialized into a Python list of Dictionary. This can be loaded into Pandas trivially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract the forecast data and load it into Pandas, then display the Time of the forecast, and high and low temperatures:\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT**: depending on the output of the weather API, you might need to use `json_normalize` as we did in the `NYC0` exercise."

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n",
